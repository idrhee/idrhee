      <description>Continuing with the series, I took a look at the 2013 opinion polls and tried to compare it to the actual election returns. All data come from the Wikipedia page on the 2013 elections. As before, I used only the data points which at least provided the sample size and the survey duration.
Trends As before, I start with the overall time trends. The overtime plot shows Uhuru rapidly narrowing the gap with Raila.</description>

      <description>It’s five days to the election, and I’ve been playing a little bit with the opinion poll data for the 2017 Kenyan Elections. To the best of my abilities, I have collected the data from newspaper articles and the releases from major survey firms. I’ve only used surveys that were at least trying to be somewhat nationally representative, and those which included some basic details about the surveys including the total number of respondents or the survey period.</description>
