# About

I am a [PhD Candidate](https://polisci.ucsd.edu/grad/current-students/index.html) at the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.ucsd.edu/), [University of California, San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu/). My research focuses on legislative and democratic development in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

My dissertation investigates the logic of legislator attention in developing democracies and examines when and how some politicians are able to focus more on national policy-making than being mere constituency servants. To answer these questions, I have been conducting extensive fieldwork in Kenya, developing an original dataset on politiciansâ€™ career background and parliamentary speeches, and conducting qualitative interviews with Kenyan voters and politicians.

My research has been supported by the [Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad (DDRA) Fellowship](https://ed.gov/programs/iegpsddrap/index.html), [National Science Foundation (NSF) Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (DDRIG)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505214). [Policy Design and Evaluation Lab (PDEL, UC San Diego)](http://pdel.ucsd.edu), [Friends of the International Center (UC San Diego)](http://icenter.ucsd.edu/friends/), and the [Korean-American Scholarship Foundation](http://www.kasf.org).  

Prior to starting the PhD program at UC San Diego, I served as an officer in the [Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF)](http://www.airforce.mil.kr:8081/user/indexMain.action?command=&siteId=airforce-eng) for over three years. From December 2016 to September 2017, I am based in Nairobi, Kenya, with my wife and two little children, where I am serving as a research associate at the [Institute for Development Studies, University of Nairobi](http://ids.uonbi.ac.ke/).
