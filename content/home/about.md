I am a [PhD Candidate](https://polisci.ucsd.edu/grad/current-students/index.html) at the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.ucsd.edu/), [University of California, San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu/). My research focuses on legislative and democratic development in Sub-Saharan Africa. My dissertation investigates the logic of legislator attention in developing democracies and examines when and how some politicians are able to focus more on national policy-making than being mere constituency servants. To answer these questions, I have been conducting extensive fieldwork in Kenya, developing an original dataset on politiciansâ€™ career background, conducting qualitative interviews with Kenyan voters and politicians, and analyzing tens of thousands of parliamentary speech texts as data.

My research has been supported by the [Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad (DDRA) Fellowship](https://ed.gov/programs/iegpsddrap/index.html), [National Science Foundation (NSF) Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (DDRIG)](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505214). [Policy Design and Evaluation Lab (PDEL, UC San Diego)](http://pdel.ucsd.edu), [Friends of the International Center (UC San Diego)](http://icenter.ucsd.edu/friends/), and the [Korean-American Scholarship Foundation](http://www.kasf.org).  

I received a MA in Political Science (2014) from [UC San Diego in Political Science](http://polisci.ucsd.edu/), a MA in International Affairs (2012) from the [School of International & Public Affairs (SIPA), Columbia University](https://sipa.columbia.edu), and a BA in Politics and Development Studies (2006)from the [School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London](https://www.soas.ac.uk). Prior to starting the PhD program at UC San Diego, I served as an officer in the [Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF)](http://www.airforce.mil.kr:8081/user/indexMain.action?command=&siteId=airforce-eng) for over three years, and was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal.  

From December 2016 to September 2017, I was based in Nairobi, Kenya, where I am serving as a research associate at the [Institute for Development Studies (IDS), University of Nairobi (UoN)](http://ids.uonbi.ac.ke/). 

This quarter (Winter 2018), I am searving as a section instructor for POLI 11 Introduction to Comparative Politics and as a graduate student mentor for POLI 198RA Research Apprenticeship.
